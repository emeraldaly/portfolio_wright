                            <p>I am a Web Developer and Project Manager with a background in operations, international relations and program facilitation.</p> </br>
                            <p>My interests are far-reaching: from improv, travel, Earth Science, Religion, Diplomacy and Journalism. I am always looking for new initiatives to grow as a thinker and contributor.</p></br>
                            <p>My journey to code started at a DC Startup Weekend conference. Everyone already had a snazzy, cool business idea. The real demand was to find a talented developer for the team.</p></br>
                            <p>Wanting to be more involved, I started to do online tutorials in coding. I took a Java Programming class. I joined and became an organizer for DC Rails Girls. And I went through a coding bootcamp focusing on javascript and the MEAN stack.</p></br>
                            <p>During the day I have largely been focused on business operations. By night, I've had my own business doing research for award-winning authors and artists. My clients increasingly request web design support. Now that I have more training as a web developer and, most importantly, a toolkit to keep learning new skills, I am looking forward to merging my past experiences and focus on product management and web development.</p></br>
