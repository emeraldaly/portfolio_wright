                            <p>I am a Web Developer and Project Manager with a background in operations, international relations and program facilitation.</p> </br>
                            <p>My interests are far-reaching: from improv, travel, Earth Science, Religion, Diplomacy and Journalism. I am always looking for new initiatives to grow as a thinker and contributor.</p></br>
                            <p>My journey to code started at a DC Startup Weekend conference. Everyone already had a snazzy, cool business idea. The real demand was to find a talented developer for their team.</p></br>
                            <p>Wanting to be more involved, I started to do online tutorials in coding. I took a Java Programming class. I joined and became an organizer for DC Rails Girls. And I went through a coding bootcamp focusing on javascript and the MEAN stack.</p></br>
                            <p>Per my general curiosity and affinity to say 'yes' to new challenges, I have had my own company doing research for authors for 6 years. My day jobs have largely focused on business operations. Now I am also web developer.</p></br>

                When I'm not working, I like to:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Perform improv. Here is a recording of my first Improv showcase from the Washington Improv Theater</li>
